# LabPro Diagnostics - Landing Page

A modern, responsive, and feature-rich landing page for a fictional diagnostics lab called "LabPro Diagnostics". This project is built with pure HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, focusing on a clean UI and a great user experience.

It serves as an excellent example of a dynamic single-page application created without a front-end framework.

## ✨ Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Sticky Navigation Bar**: Header sticks to the top on scroll with a smooth background and text color transition.
- **Dynamic Content**: All major sections (Services, Packages, Centers, Testimonials) are dynamically rendered from a single JavaScript data object (`labData`), making content management easy.
- **Interactive Filtering & Searching**:
  - Filter services by category and search for specific tests.
  - Filter lab centers by city and search by name or address.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Seamless navigation to different sections of the page.
- **Interactive UI Elements**:
  - "Lift-up" hover animations on all cards.
  - Collapsible "View Details" section for health packages.
  - Interactive testimonial slider.
- **Client-Side Form Validation**: A simple and effective contact form with real-time validation and a success state.
- **Mobile-First Menu**: A clean, accessible hamburger menu for mobile devices.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first CSS workflow, enabling rapid and consistent styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all interactivity, dynamic content rendering, and DOM manipulation.
- **Google Fonts**: For the "Inter" font family.

## 🛠️ Setup and Usage

This is a static website and requires no build process or dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your browser:**
    You can simply double-click the `index.html` file, or use a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's "Live Server") for a better development experience with hot-reloading.
